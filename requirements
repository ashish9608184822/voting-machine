A Electronic voting machine is basically a digital machine that accepts votes and display the result.IN this blog we are gonna know about how to design a model of 
simple electronic machine in C
The project is divided into few parts
->The program first asks to enter the information of the participants participating in the election and a symbol(only special characters) for each of them.
  Restriction: Any two people taking the two symbol should not be permitted,an error message should be displayed.

->Entering the voter id present in the csv file click here for sample csv file .
sample CSV:
VOTER ID    NAME      AGE
33589     Theon       38
67840     Arya        79
57949     John        35
59485     Tyrion      38
39486     Jaime       23
69506     Cleagane    18
73940     Jorah       72

Restriction: A person should vote only once ,if the voted voter id is entered error symbol is displayed.

->casting the vote- The voter will be allowed to vote a candidate by choosing the symbol.
 Restriction:If wrong symbol is entered error message will be displayed.

->Displaying option such as
•	results
•	difference
•	finish voting
•	exit the poll
->Once the 4th option is entered that is to exit the poll.The candidates information like name,symbol and final number of votes are displayed. And the special thing is that 
one file for each participant will be displayed containing his details..

Who
Anyone who are interested to revise there basics concepts in C can play the game to relax.

What
This project is concerned about developing a game which makes us to think basics to win the game.

When
The students are encouraged to think more about basics. Which can help them in learning C language for there future.

Why
As this project uses C programming language it can be easy to understand the logic.

How
Implemented using Functions , loops and other functionalities of C.

Basic requirements that very essential are:
Operating System: Windows, Linux or any other operating system

Front end tool: Visual Studio Code
